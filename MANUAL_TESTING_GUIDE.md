SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users;

-- Check remaining courses
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.section, u.name as teacher_name 
FROM courses c 
LEFT JOIN users u ON c.teacher_id = u.id;

-- Check remaining attendance (should be 0 after deletions)
SELECT COUNT(*) as attendance_count FROM attendances;

-- Check remaining marks (should be 0 after deletions)
SELECT COUNT(*) as marks_count FROM marks;

-- Verify no orphaned records
SELECT * FROM attendances WHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
SELECT * FROM attendances WHERE course_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM courses);
SELECT * FROM marks WHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM users);
SELECT * FROM marks WHERE course_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM courses);
```

## üéØ Key Testing Points

### 1. Authentication
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens are generated on login
- ‚úÖ Tokens are required for protected endpoints
- ‚úÖ Invalid tokens are rejected

### 2. Authorization
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control works
- ‚úÖ Admin has full access
- ‚úÖ Teacher can manage courses and data
- ‚úÖ Student can only view own data
- ‚úÖ Parent can view student data

### 3. Data Operations
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations work correctly
- ‚úÖ Validation is enforced
- ‚úÖ Cascade deletes maintain integrity

### 4. Security
- ‚úÖ Passwords are never returned
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access is blocked
- ‚úÖ Forbidden operations return 403
- ‚úÖ Unauthenticated requests return 401

---

## üìù Notes for Testers

1. **Token Management**: Always save tokens after login. They expire after 24 hours.

2. **ID Tracking**: Keep track of IDs (teacherId, studentId, courseId) as you'll need them for subsequent requests.

3. **Expected Failures**: Steps 27-32 are supposed to fail with 403/401. This validates security.

4. **Cascade Deletes**: When you delete a course or user, related records are automatically deleted.

5. **Date Format**: Always use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates.

6. **Score Range**: Marks must be between 0 and 100.

7. **Email Validation**: Emails must be in valid format.

8. **Password Security**: Minimum 6 characters required.

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: 401 Unauthorized
**Cause**: Token not provided or expired  
**Solution**: Login again and get a new token

### Issue 2: 403 Forbidden
**Cause**: User role doesn't have permission  
**Solution**: Use the correct role token (e.g., adminToken for admin operations)

### Issue 3: 404 Not Found
**Cause**: Resource doesn't exist  
**Solution**: Verify the ID exists in the database

### Issue 4: 400 Bad Request
**Cause**: Invalid data in request  
**Solution**: Check request body format and validation rules

### Issue 5: 500 Internal Server Error
**Cause**: Server-side error  
**Solution**: Check application logs for details
